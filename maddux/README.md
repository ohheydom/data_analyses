# What's the Opposite of a Maddux?

### Information

In baseball, a complete game shutout under 100 pitches is considered a Maddux, named after the first ballot Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux. He was known for his extremely efficient games. Were there any other players more efficient than Greg Maddux? And what about the opposite, what would we call a complete game shutout over 125 pitches?

### Data

The data has been scraped from [baseball-reference.com](http://www.baseball-reference.com). Unfortunately, pitch counts weren't recorded until 1988, so generations of players could not be used here. I've included the 50 players with the most complete games (not just shutouts) within the last 28 years.
