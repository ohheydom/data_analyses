# Baseball's Longest 2-Wins-in-a-row Droughts

### Information

The Mets have been terribly average recently. As of August 8th, the Mets haven't won two games in a row since the beginning of July. I knew that there had to have been worse teams in the history of baseball and sought to find the longest two wins in a row droughts by franchise.
